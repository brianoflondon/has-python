# has-python
A very basic demo to show Hive Authentication Service (HAS) in Python

`git clone https://github.com/brianoflondon/has-python.git .`

You'll need Poetry

`poetry install`

And then the command `has` should work.

`has --help`

`has brianoflondon`

This will spawn a window with a QR code, snap that with Hive Keychain or any other PKSA and it should confirm.
